“I never tried to prove nothing, just wanted to give a good show. My life has always been my music, it&#8217;s always come first, but the music ain&#8217;t worth nothing if you can&#8217;t lay it on the public. The main thing is to live for that audience, &#8217;cause what you&#8217;re there for is to please the people.”
